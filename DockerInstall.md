# Installing Crypti (using Docker)

This tutorial describes how to install the Crypti - Delegate and Developer Edition, using a Docker based container.

## 1. Install Docker

### Windows / Mac OS X

1. Download and install [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox) for your operating system.
2. Open the Docker Quickstart Terminal.

#### PuTTY / SSH Access

You can optionally login to your Docker virtual machine, using [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) or any other SSH client.

To do so, please use the following credentials:

* Host: `192.168.99.100`
* Port: `22`
* Login: `docker`
* Password: `tcuser`

### Ubuntu

Log onto your Ubuntu based server and enter the following commands:

**NOTE:** The following is only applicable to: **Ubuntu 14.04 (LTS) - x86_64**.

```
curl -sL http://cryptidownloads.lisk.io/setup_docker | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y docker-engine
```

## 2. Install Crypti

To install and run the latest version of Crypti - Delegate and Developer Edition, simply run the following commands:

Download the latest docker image:

```
curl -o docker_image.tar.gz http://cryptidownloads.lisk.io/docker_image.tar.gz
zcat docker_image.tar.gz | docker load
```

Install the docker image (executed only once per installation):

```
docker run -d --restart=always -p 0.0.0.0:8040:8040 cryptichain/node
```

**NOTE:** On Windows or Mac OS X, these commands are issued from within the Docker Quickstart Terminal.

Upon successful completion, you will have a running Crypti node with an up-to-date snapshot of the blockchain. The container is configured to automatically restart upon reboot of the server or any occurrence of an error.

To access the Crypti web client, open: [http://192.168.99.100:8040/](http://192.168.99.100:8040/), or replace **192.168.99.100** with your public IP address.

The Crypti web client should launch successfully.

## 3. Update Crypti

To update to the latest version of Crypti - Delegate and Developer Edition, simply run the following commands:

**WARNING:** The provided instructions will **remove the previous container** and **create a new one**. Please be sure to backup any data before proceeding. See: `docker cp --help` for more information on how to copy files from the container to the host machine.

Get the docker container id:

```
docker ps -a
```

Stop the docker container (replace **container_id** with your own id):

```
docker stop container_id
```

Remove the old container (replace **container_id** with your own id):

```
docker rm container_id
```

Download the latest docker image:

```
docker pull cryptichain/node
```

Install the docker image (executed only once per installation):

```
docker run -d --restart=always -p 0.0.0.0:8040:8040 cryptichain/node
```

Remove any dangling images:

```
docker rmi $(docker images -q --filter "dangling=true")
```

Your docker image should now be updated.

## 4. Enable Forging

To enable forging for one or more delegates, simply follow the below instructions.

Get the docker container id:

```
docker ps -a
```

Open a bash prompt on the docker container (replace **container_id** with your own id):

```
docker exec -it container_id bash
```

Open config.json:

```
export TERM=xterm; nano config.json
```

Arrow down until you find the following section:

```
"forging": {
  "secret" : [""]
}
```

Set the secret parameter to your account secret phrase.

```
"forging": {
  "secret" : ["YourDelegatePassphrase"] <- Replace with your delegate passphrase
}
```

(Optional) In the forging section you will also see an access property, this is used to allow only your IP address to enable forging through the web client.

```
"access": {
  "whiteList": ["127.0.0.1"] <- Replace with the IP which you will use to access your node
}
```

To set 2 accounts to forge on a single node, enter both account passphrases like below.

```
"forging": {
  "secret" : ["YourDelegatePassphrase1","YourDelegatePassphrase2"] <- Replace with your delegate passphrases
  "access": {
    "whiteList": ["127.0.0.1"]
  }
}
```

After you have typed in your passphrase. Hit: `Ctrl+ X` Then: `Y`

Exit the docker container:

```
exit
```

Restart the docker container (replace **container_id** with your own id):

```
docker restart container_id
```

Then, open the Crypti web client and wait for the blockchain to load. Once the blockchain has loaded, navigate to "Forging" section, and verify that **Forging (Enabled)** appears in the top left corner.

## 5. Enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

**NOTE:** To complete this step you require a signed certificate (from a CA) and a public and private key pair.

Get the docker container id:

```
docker ps -a
```

Open a bash prompt on the docker container (replace **container_id** with your own id):

```
docker exec -it container_id bash
```

Open config.json:

```
export TERM=xterm; nano config.json
```

Arrow down until you find the following section:

```
"ssl": {
  "enabled": false,         < Change FROM false TO true
  "options": {
    "port": 443,            < Default SSL Port
    "address": "0.0.0.0",   < Change only if you wish to block web access to the node
    "key": "path_to_key",   < Replace FROM path_to_key TO actual path to key file
    "cert": "path_to_cert"  < Replace FROM path_to_cert TO actual path to certificate file
  }
}
```

After you are done, save changes and exit. Hit: `Ctrl+ X` Then: `Y`

Exit the docker container:

```
exit
```

Stop the docker container (replace **container_id** with your own id):

```
docker stop container_id
```

Commit a new docker image (replace **container_id** with your own id):

```
docker commit container_id secure_node
```

Run the new docker image:

```
docker run -d --restart=always -p 0.0.0.0:8040:8040 0.0.0.0:443:443 secure_node
```

Open the web client. You should now have an SSL enabled connection.

## 7. Troubleshooting

If you encounter the following error when running `docker` commands:

```
cannot enable tty mode on non tty input
```

Then please try running each command prefixed with `winpty`. For example: `winpty docker ps -a`.

***

If you encounter the following error when running `docker` commands:

```
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?
```

Then please try running each command prefixed with `sudo`. For example: `sudo docker ps -a`.

If this does not work, please check the Docker daemon is running correctly before proceeding.

***

If you encounter an error while downloading the docker image, using the `docker pull` command.

Please use the following alternative download method:

```
curl -o docker_image.tar.gz http://cryptidownloads.lisk.io/docker_image.tar.gz
zcat docker_image.tar.gz | docker load
```

Then proceed with the remainder of the [installation instructions](DockerInstall.md#2-install-crypti).
