# Installing Crypti (from Source)

This tutorial describes how to install the Crypti - Delegate and Developer Edition from source, on a Ubuntu based machine.

**NOTE:** The following is only applicable to: **Ubuntu 14.04 (LTS) - x86_64**.

## 1. Install Essentials

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl build-essential python wget unzip
```

## 2. Install SQLite3

```
curl -sL http://cryptidownloads.lisk.io/setup_sqlite3 | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y sqlite3
```

After it installs, check version of sqlite3:

```
sqlite3 -version
```

SQLite3 should have the following version number: `3.8.2`

## 3. Install Node.js

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

After it installs, check version of Node.js/npm:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

- Node.js should have the following version number: `v0.12.9`
- npm should have the following version number: `2.14.9`

## 4. Install Crypti

Download the Crypti archive:

```
wget http://downloads.crypti.me/crypti-node/0.5.x/0.5.4.zip
```

Unzip the archive:

```
unzip 0.5.4.zip
```

Change directory:

```
cd 0.5.4
```

Install node modules:

```
npm install --production
```

## 5. Install Crypti Node

This is a specialized version of Node.js used to execute dapps within a virtual machine.

Download the Crypti Node archive:

```
wget http://cryptidownloads.lisk.io/crypti-node.zip
```

Unzip the archive:

```
unzip crypti-node.zip
```

Check version of Node.js:

```
nodejs/node -v
```

- Node.js should have the following version number: `v0.12.2`

## 6. Download Blockchain

Download the blockchain archive:

```
wget http://cryptidownloads.lisk.io/blockchain.db.zip
```

Unzip the archive:

```
unzip blockchain.db.zip
```

## 7. Start Crypti

Install forever, a Node.js process manager:

```
sudo npm install -g forever
```

Next synchronize your machine's clock:

```
sudo service ntp stop
sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org
sudo service ntp start
```

**NOTE:** Some systems don't have ntp running so you may get the message "ntp: unrecognized service". This is ok just continue with next command.

Start Crypti:

```
forever start app.js
```

The Crypti process, logs, and etc can be found with the command:

```
forever list
```

You will see list of working Node.js processes with logs, process ids and indexes.

Verify that Crypti has started without any errors and synchronized with the db.

After it starts, open: [http://localhost:8040/](http://localhost:8040/), or replace **localhost** with your public IP address.

The Crypti web client should launch successfully.

## 8. Enable Forging

If you are running your node from a local machine, you can enable forging through the web client, without further interruption. **NOTE:** Should the Crypti node or machine need to be restarted, you will need to re-enable forging again.

If your node is running on a remote machine, or if you want to keep forging persistently enabled, you will need to follow the below instructions.

Stop the running Crypti node:

```
forever stop app.js
```

Open config.json:

```
nano config.json
```

Arrow down until you find the following section:

```
"forging": {
  "secret" : [""]
}
```

Set the secret parameter to your account secret phrase.

```
"forging": {
  "secret" : ["YourDelegatePassphrase"] <- Replace with your delegate passphrase
}
```

(Optional) In the forging section you will also see an access property, this is used to allow only your IP address to enable forging through the web client.

```
"access": {
  "whiteList": ["127.0.0.1"] <- Replace with your IP which you will use to access your node
}
```

To set 2 accounts to forge on a single node, enter both account passphrases like below.

```
"forging": {
  "secret" : ["YourDelegatePassphrase1","YourDelegatePassphrase2"] <- Replace with your delegate passphrases
  "access": {
    "whiteList": ["127.0.0.1"]
  }
}
```

After you have typed in your passphrase. Hit: `Ctrl+ X` Then: `Y`

Start Crypti:

```
forever start app.js
```

Then, open the Crypti web client and wait for the blockchain to load. Once the blockchain has loaded, navigate to "Forging" section, and verify that **Forging (Enabled)** appears in the top left corner.

## 9. Enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

**NOTE:** To complete this step you require a signed certificate (from a CA) and a public and private key pair.

Stop the running Crypti node:

```
forever stop app.js
```

Open config.json:

```
nano config.json
```

Arrow down until you find the following section:

```
"ssl": {
  "enabled": false,         < Change FROM false TO true
  "options": {
    "port": 443,            < Default SSL Port
    "address": "0.0.0.0",   < Change only if you wish to block web access to the node
    "key": "path_to_key",   < Replace FROM path_to_key TO actual path to key file
    "cert": "path_to_cert"  < Replace FROM path_to_cert TO actual path to certificate file
  }
}
```

After you are done, save changes and exit. Hit: `Ctrl+ X` Then: `Y`

**NOTE:** If SSL Port configured above (ssl > options > port) is within well known ports range (below 1024), you must start Crypti with admin rights:

```
sudo forever start app.js
```

If the port is above 1023, you can start Crypti normally:

```
forever start app.js
```

Open the web client. You should now have an SSL enabled connection.

## 10. Configure Autostart

To have Crypti automatically start each time your machine boots:

1. Install forever-service, a Node.js service manager:

  ```
  sudo npm install forever-service -g
  ```

2. Change to your Crypti folder and run:

  ```
  forever-service install crypti
  ```

Your Crypti node should now automatically start when booting your machine. By installing Crypti as a service, it also allows you to manage your node using the following commands:

* Start: ```sudo start crypti```
* Stop:  ```sudo stop crypti```
* Restart:  ```sudo restart crypti```
* Status:  ```sudo status crypti```

## 11. Troubleshooting

If one of the following errors occur:

  * `bash: /usr/local/bin/forever: No such file or directory`
  * `npm ERR! cb() never called!`
  * `npm ERR! not ok code 0`

It is likely that *forever*, *nodejs* or your *home folder* has been removed.

Please ensure that your old Crypti client isn't running anymore. Then follow the these steps:

  1. Run `sudo apt-get clean`
  2. Run `sudo apt-get update`
  3. Follow the installation guide again (don't just re-install forever!)
  4. Run `sudo npm cache clear`
  5. Run `sudo npm install -g forever`

Your problem should now be resolved.
